## About Me

I am an empirical economist at the [Austrian Institute of Economic Research](https://www.wifo.ac.at), working in the research group ["Regional Economics and Spatial Analysis"](https://www.wifo.ac.at/jart/prj3/wifo/main.jart?rel=en&content-id=1354870251053). I graduated with a Ph.D. in Economics from the [University of Regensburg](https://www.ur.de) (Germany) in 2021.

## Research Interests

My research interests lie in particular in **urban, regional, and real estate economics**. To date, my work has focused on the implications of homeownership subsidies on the spatial distribution of population, housing, and housing prices.
