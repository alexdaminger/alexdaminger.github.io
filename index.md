## About Me

I studied Economics in [Munich](https://www.econ.lmu.de/de/index.html) and [Regensburg](https://www.uni-regensburg.de/wirtschaftswissenschaften/vwl/startseite/index.html) and spent a semester abroad at the [University of Kansas](https://ku.edu/), USA. I graduated from LMU Munich with a Bachelor of Science in Economics in 2014 and from the University of Regensburg with a Master of Science in Economics in 2017. I completed my PhD in Economics at the University of Regensburg in 2021.

From 2017 to 2021, I was a research associate at the [Chair for Retail Real Estate](https://www.uni-regensburg.de/business-economics-and-management-information-systems/real-estate-dascher/homepage/index.html) at Regensburg University. From 2021 to 2022, I worked as a consultant in Deloitte Germany's transfer pricing team. Since April 2022, I have been an economist in the research group “[Regional Economics and Spatial Analysis](https://www.wifo.ac.at/jart/prj3/wifo/main.jart?rel=en&content-id=1354870251053)” at the [Austrian Institute of Economic Research](https://www.wifo.ac.at) in Vienna, Austria.

## Research Interests

My research interests lie in particular in **urban, regional, and real estate economics**. To date, my work has focused on the implications of homeownership subsidies on the spatial distribution of population, housing, and housing prices.
